Here are instructions about how to set up virtual environments on a macOS, Linux, or Windows machine using the terminal: instructions link.

These are a few notes for understanding the tutorial:

If you are using Python 2.7.9 or later (including Python 3), 
the Python installation should already come with the Python package manager called pip. 
There is no need to install it.
env is the name of the environment you want to create. You can call env anything you want.
Python 3 comes with a virtual environment package pre-installed. 

So instead of typing python3 -m virtualenv env, 
you can type python3 -m venv env to create a virtual environment.
Once you've activated a virtual environment, you can then use terminal commands to go into the directory where your Python library is stored. 

And then you can run pip install .. 
In the next section, you can practice pip installing and/or creating virtual environments in the classroom workspace. 
You'll see that creating a virtual environment actually creates a new folder containing a Python installation. 
Deleting this folder will remove the virtual environment.

Note that if you install packages on the workspace and run into issues, you can always reset the workspace; however, you will lose all of your work. So be sure to download any files you want to keep before resetting a workspace.
